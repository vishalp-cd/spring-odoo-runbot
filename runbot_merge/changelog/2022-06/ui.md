IMP: various UI items

- more clearly differentiate between "pending" and "unknown" statuses on stagings
- fix "outstanding forward ports" count
- add date of staging last modification (= success / failure instant)
- correctly retrieve and include fast-forward and unstaging reasons
- show the warnings banner (e.g. staging disabled) on the PR pages, as not all
  users routinely visit the main dashboard
